# PACE Infrastructure

This is the repository for DSU Applied Research Lab's fork of [pwncollege/dojo](https://github.com/pwncollege/dojo).
This fork was created to facilitate the PACE project at DSU ARL.

## Fork Background
PACE is DSU's codename for the [ACE Institute](https://ctf.asu.edu/education/ace/) in partnership with Arizona State University.
This modified version of [pwn.college](https://pwn.college) will eventually facilitate the [Governer's Cyber Academy](https://dsu.edu/admissions/undergraduate/cyber-academy.html), starting with the Cyber Roadshows.

## Contributing

### General Public
This fork is not accepting public contributions at this time.
Feel free to submit pull requests to the upstream repository at [pwncollege/dojo](https://github.com/pwncollege/dojo).

### DSU PACE Team
Because this is a divergent fork, we need to reduce any git craziness.
For this reason, only repository admins may force push to some branches.
Please make a branch off of master and open a pull request for all changes.
Repository admins will handle pulling in upstream changes.

**Remember! This repository is currently public!**
